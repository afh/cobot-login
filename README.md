# cobot-login

This script logs you into [cobot][]'s captive portal. It's sort of like [Alexis][alexis]' script (for Mac OS X), but for Ubuntu.

# Todo

 * MacOSX: use keychain to find user/password (port from existing script)
 * Ubuntu: use sqlite to mine chrome's db for user/password
 * Ubuntu: no notifications are sent - even though it works
